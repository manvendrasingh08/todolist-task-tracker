## 🧪 Testing Guidance

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### ✅ Task Addition
- [ ] Add a task with valid text (3-100 characters)
- [ ] Try adding empty task (should show validation error)
- [ ] Try adding task with < 3 characters (should show validation error)
- [ ] Try adding task with > 100 characters (should show validation error)
- [ ] Add tasks with different priority levels
- [ ] Verify tasks appear in the list immediately

#### ✅ Task Management
- [ ] Mark tasks as complete/incomplete by clicking checkbox
- [ ] Delete individual tasks using the X button
- [ ] Verify completed tasks show with strikethrough text
- [ ] Clear all completed tasks using "Clear Completed" button

#### ✅ Filtering & Sorting
- [ ] Test "All" filter shows all tasks
- [ ] Test "Active" filter shows only incomplete tasks
- [ ] Test "Completed" filter shows only completed tasks
- [ ] Test sorting by "Date Created" (newest first)
- [ ] Test sorting by "Alphabetical" (A-Z)
- [ ] Test sorting by "Priority" (High > Medium > Low)

#### ✅ Data Persistence
- [ ] Add several tasks, refresh the page, verify tasks persist
- [ ] Complete some tasks, refresh the page, verify completion status persists
- [ ] Clear browser localStorage, verify app starts with empty list

#### ✅ UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify animations and transitions work smoothly
- [ ] Check toast notifications appear for all actions
- [ ] Verify priority indicators show correct colors
- [ ] Test hover effects on interactive elements

#### ✅ Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with very long task names
- [ ] Test with special characters in task names
- [ ] Test with many tasks (50+) to check performance
- [ ] Test clearing all tasks
- [ ] Test with only completed or only active tasks

### 🔧 Automated Testing Setup (Optional)

To add automated tests, you can install testing dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event vitest jsdom
```

Create test files for each component:
- `TaskInput.test.tsx`
- `TaskItem.test.tsx` 
- `TaskFilters.test.tsx`
- `TodoList.test.tsx`

### 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Tasks not persisting**: Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser
2. **Validation not working**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled
3. **Styling issues**: Clear browser cache and reload
4. **Performance with many tasks**: The app is optimized but consider pagination for 100+ tasks

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

## 📝 Usage Examples

1. **Adding a Task**: Type your task, select priority, click "Add Task"
2. **Completing a Task**: Click the checkbox next to any task
3. **Filtering Tasks**: Use the All/Active/Completed buttons
4. **Sorting Tasks**: Use the dropdown to change sort order
5. **Deleting Tasks**: Click the X button on any task
6. **Clearing Completed**: Use the "Clear Completed" button when available

## 🎨 Customization

The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can easily customize:
- Colors by modifying the Tailwind classes
- Priority colors in `TaskItem.tsx`
- Layout spacing and sizing
- Animation durations and effects
